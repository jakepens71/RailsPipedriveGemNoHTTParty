	*HTTParty error caused URI issues (of course!) Sorry reverting back!
		PipedirvePUT::Search.search() no longer uses HTTParty

# (1.1.21) August 6th, 2015 1:53 PM
	*Fixed PipedrivePUT::Search.search uri.

# (1.1.20) August 6th, 2015 11:48 AM
	*switched "PipedrivePUT::Search.search" from regular ruby request to use HTTparty.
		I was having trouble for some very odd reason getting this request to work on a server
		This should NOT cause any problems with the previous releases. It still returns the same data 
		just a diffrent request. If ANYONE has any trouble please let me know asap and I will then add
		the previous method back in.
