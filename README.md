NOTE: This searches for everything in Pipedrive (deal, organization, user, state, product, etc.) 

I hope to add additional support to break this down at a later time.


Data is returned in JSON format.

This can be easily customized. I needed something quickly and easily for my own personal project.

This is my first attempt at a ruby gem so I appoligize if things are unorthodox.

The Pipedrive API can be found at:
https://developers.pipedrive.com/v1

## To do List


1. Add support for additional arguments when creating a deal

2. Add ability to search for recent changes by specific types onle (deal, organization, user, state, etc.)

3. Many other Pipedrive API Calls
